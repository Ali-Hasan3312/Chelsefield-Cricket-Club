            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Dear Members, Supporters, and Friends of Chelsfield Cricket Club,
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              As Chairman of this great club, I would like to take this
              opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been
              part of Chelsfield Cricket Club over the past year. Whether you
              are a player, coach, volunteer, sponsor, or supporter, your
              contribution has been invaluable to our continued success both on
              and off the field.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This season has brought with it many highlights. Our teams have
              shown tremendous spirit and determination, and we are proud of the
              progress made across all age groups. The commitment of our players
              and coaching staff to developing their skills and pushing for
              excellence is evident, and the results are a testament to their
              hard work.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              But Chelsfield Cricket Club is more than just the cricket we play.
              It is about the community we are building together—a community
              where all are welcome, where young and old come together to share
              in the passion for the game.
            </p>

        <div className="w-[90%] mx-auto mt-4">
          <p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our membership continues to grow, and it is heartening to see the
            next generation of players thriving, learning, and developing not
            just as cricketers but as individuals who embody the spirit of
            sportsmanship. I would like to acknowledge the tireless work of our
            management and sub-committees and volunteers. Without your efforts
            behind the scenes, none of this would be possible.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Looking ahead, we have exciting plans for the future. Whether it is
            improving our facilities, expanding our youth programme, or
            strengthening our competitive teams, we are focused on ensuring that
            Chelsfield Cricket Club remains a hub for cricketing excellence and
            community engagement for many years to come.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Finally, I want to thank all our sponsors and supporters. Your
            generosity and belief in our club allow us to continue growing and
            providing opportunities for all to enjoy the game we love.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            As we look forward to the next chapter in our club’s journey, let us
            continue to support each other and celebrate all that makes
            Chelsfield Cricket Club the special place it is.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white text-lg mt-4">Yours sincerely,</p>
